# High Availability Webapp using AWS CloudFormation


This project deploys a high-availability Web Application. 
AWS CloudFormation Infrastructure-as-code (IAC) automates the entire creation process and environment. The deployment uses packaged application that is staged in an AWS S3 bucket into a dockerized Apache Web Server. The script, written in a YAML files contains configurations needed to automate the entire deploymeny process so that the same coded infrastructure can be created, destroyed and recycled as when necessary.
